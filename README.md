# Conditional-Generative-Adversarial-Networks

The repository contains example code for conditional Generative Adversarial Model written in theno and Lasagne. The code follows the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1784 but with a different deep architecture. 

Very basic MLP architecture is used for both the discriminator and the generator as well

# Execution 
Just download mnist.npz file and type python Conditional_GAN.py.

# Digit creation
You can chose your own digit by changing the 'Digit_Generate' at line 74
